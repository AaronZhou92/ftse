First, you need an instance of eclipse for development. For this, you can some updated version of the platform such as [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/galileor Original Eclipse] or [http://www.springsource.com/products/sts SpringSource Tool Suite].

= Eclipse + Subversion =

== Subversion Plugin == 
When your eclipse is ready, then please install the Subversion required library from [http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA] to have subclipse enabled in your eclipse.

== Subclipse Plugin Configuration ==
After you have your subclipse feature enabled in your eclipse, you just need to do some slight configuration for Subverstion:
  # In eclipse menu, *Window*, choose *Preferences*
  # Under the preference tree, find *Team* and then *SVN*
  # Under *SVN*, in the right pane, find *SNV Interface* and change it to *SVNKit (Pure Java)...*
  # Click OK and you're done.

= Source Checkout =
To check out the source:
  # In eclipse menu, *File -> Import ...*
  # Under *SVN* choose *Check out project from SVN*, and click *Next*
  # Choose *Create a new repository location* and click *Next*
  # Under *URL*, enter *[https://ftse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/]* and click *Next*
  # You're asked for your Google Code password which you can find [https://code.google.com/hosting/settings here].
  # Checkout the project as a new or an existing one that you have.
