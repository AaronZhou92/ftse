= MySQL =

An instance of MySQL is required to *default* run the project. If you have the knowledge you can configure whatever database you'd like through the *Spring* configurations in the project.

If you just want to give it a try, you can install an instance of MySQL from [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html here].


= Database Setup =
To initialize a database:
  # Login as the *root* user or any user with sufficient privileges
  # Create a database(catalog) named *ftse*
  # Run the script under *src/main/resources/ftse.sql*

= Database User/Password =
If you need to use a different user or password with the database, you can configure it in configuration file under *src/main/resources/configs/ftse-config.xml* for the bean named *dataSource*.
